Magic 8-ball
1.
Since we know that magic 8-ball starts at the address
0x7fffffffe000 and that we are looking for magic8ball[3][4], we can find the address by taking [3][4] and converting it based on the base of 8, giving us 
3 * 64 + 4 * 8 = 224
By converting it to hex, I get 0xe0. 
Since we start at e000, we get 0x7fffffffe0e0 as our address for magic8ball[3][4].

The values we get are

0x57 0x72 0x6f 0x6e 0x67 0x00 0x00 0x00

which we can convert to ascii, giving us

Wrong

with 0x00 being null, thus signifying the end.

This means the statement printf(“%s”, magic8ball[3][4]); prints out:
Wrong
